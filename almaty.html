                    architectural landmarks of the city. The cathedral was designed by architect Andrey Pavlovich Zenkov

                    religious and cultural center for Orthodox believers. The Ascension Cathedral also survived an
                    earthquake in 1911, which testifies to its strength and craftsmanship of construction.

                    Today, the Ascension Cathedral is not only an active temple, but also a popular tourist attraction.
                    It is located in the park named after 28 Panfilov Guards, which makes it easily accessible to
                    visitors. The cathedral plays an important role in the spiritual life of the city and is a symbol of
                    the historical and cultural heritage of Almaty.</p>
